## Template Files

Custom templates for the Vintage Software marketing department. The code in the above files can be used to customize the user interface of  various services. All you have to do is copy and paste the code into the appropriate area and our custom themes will make your content look good!

### blog-template

To customize blog posts on the Estate Sales blog, you can copy and paste the code in the `blog-template` file into the editor on your blog page. This makes the page use a modern-looking theme.

### WooBox Template

WooBox is a Q&A service that we use. Their user interface isn't very good, so you can copy and paste the code in the `woobox-template` file to make the UI look better.

If you have any questions about this repository get with David, Erica, or Matt.
