<p>There&rsquo;s nothing quite&nbsp;like stumbling upon a treasure at an estate sale. The rush of the find, the thrill of the bargain.&nbsp;Yep. You know that feeling. That&rsquo;s the same feeling we had when we found this old barn door at a local sale.</p>

<p>For this DIY&nbsp;project, we decided to repurpose our barn door into a standing desk. The barnwood top paired with&nbsp;the galvanized steel pipe legs gives the table a rustic industrial feel. This took a lot of work, but we think it turned out great!</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16568/550x650_0010_img_3048_720.jpg" />

<p>We didn&rsquo;t do much hunting for the door because it truly found us&nbsp;(as all great estate sale finds do). It was love at first sight. Plus, it was a bargain,&nbsp;priced at only $25!&nbsp;The patina look of the barnwood is what pulled us in. The door is completely solid but had a few rough spots and some spacing issues. It was also very dirty and smelly, but we decided we were up for the challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first step when working with any old or reclaimed wood is to clean it. Our door was pretty dirty&nbsp;so we scrubbed it&nbsp;using a cleaning solution made up of warm water, orange solvent, and wood floor cleaner. (We used a 2:1:1 ratio)</p>

<p>The goal was to clean the surface of the wood and remove any loose debris,&nbsp;not to soak it. A basic kitchen scrub brush was used for this part, but any sturdy&nbsp;brush should&nbsp;work.</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16513/barndoor_0020_IMG_9214.jpg" />

<p>While the door was drying, we painted the pipes. The spray paint had a hammered effect to it, which added to&nbsp;the rustic theme.&nbsp;It also helped mask any imperfections or writing on the pipes.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16565/550x650_0009_IMG_9152.jpg" />

<p>After the barn door dried for a few days, we began removing some of the boards and moving them down to fill the gaps. Judging by the saw marks on the boards, the door is fairly old. Given the age, it came as no surprise when the boards refused to budge.&nbsp;The rusted nails seemed as if they were fused to the wood itself. But with patience and a crow bar, we were able to piece our desk&#39;s top together.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16515/barndoor_0022_IMG_9190.jpg" />

<p>Parts of the desk were very uneven. We didn&#39;t want to take away too much of the character, so a hand planer was sparingly used to help level the surface. Again, the&nbsp;wood is very old and it&rsquo;s clearly been exposed to the elements&nbsp;and animals. A totally level surface is out of the question, but this is pretty close.&nbsp;The sanding began using an orbital sander with 80 grit sandpaper.&nbsp;We continued the sanding process using a 120 grit then 220 grit sanding sponge before sealing the wood.</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16512/barndoor_0018_IMG_9251.jpg" />

<p>The choice of how to finish the table&nbsp;was not easy. Our main goal was to maintain as much of the wood&rsquo;s original character as possible. Paint was never an option because the wood is just too beautiful! After a bit of research, we decided to use a clear satin spar urethane to enhance the barn door&#39;s natural beauty and to provide a smooth and durable&nbsp;work surface.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to use a good quality paintbrush for this step, like a natural bristle brush,&nbsp;to minimize bristles left behind.</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16511/barndoor_0015_IMG_9340.jpg" />

<p>The entire table was sanded between each coat using&nbsp;a 220 grit sanding sponge. Then, we used a damp cloth to wipe the table clean.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16564/550x650_0005_IMG_9350 crop in.jpg" />

<p>One coat was applied to the bottom of the table and three were applied to the top. The table was left for about a week to give it plenty of time to dry.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16569/550x650_0004_IMG_9477.jpg" />

<p>The flanges were attached before assembling the desk. Oak is a hardwood so pilot holes were drilled first. The desk top was then moved to its new home to be pieced together.</p>

<p>The unique thing about our desk is that all the fittings are adjustable. We found our fittings&nbsp;at a local industrial supply store for just a few dollars more than traditional fittings would have been. They could also&nbsp;easily be found online or at your&nbsp;local hardware store. The&nbsp;pipes were cut by a hardware store and had some rough edges, so we made sure to burr them out&nbsp;before assembly. This is an important step because the pipes won&rsquo;t fit inside each other if skipped.&nbsp;</p>

<img src="https://hostingcdn.estatesales.net/d/126/16510/barndoor_0013_IMG_9536.jpg" />

<p>Assembling the legs was pretty simple. First, the 1&frac14;&rdquo; pipes were attached to the base using an Allen wrench to tighten the flange bolts. The 1&rdquo; pipes slid right into the larger pipes. Next, we slipped four of the single socket tees onto the legs and two onto the opposing support pipes so the foot support could be added. All of these were tightened into place. The height of our desk is 39&quot;,&nbsp;but this can be adjusted at any time.</p>

<p>The finish on this piece is gorgeous. We&rsquo;re pretty proud of how it turned out. We love how the original saw marks stand out now and how the wood shines. Success!</p>
